# Onboarding Guide

## Developer Set Up
### GPG set up
- Follow gpg/gpg-setup.md
- If you have a onlykey (may switch to yubikey later, TBD), then you will also follow: gpg/gpg-add-onlykey.md


I also recommend creating an onlykey SSH key in slot ECC5 so that you can use the same hardware token to log in everywhere.
